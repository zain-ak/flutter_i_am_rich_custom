# flutter_i_am_rich

A practice Flutter application I created while following one of the tutorial sections in the Flutter course offered on [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart).

After completing the tutorial, I made my own additions. The original application just shows an image you've uploaded as a resource and included in `pubspec.yaml`. 
I went ahead and implemented a simple [Column](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html) view with two children; the original image and a [CarouselSlider](https://pub.dev/packages/carousel_slider). The `CarouselSlider` holds an additional image
within a `Container` and there are three items inside which you can slide.

Much yay. 🙌🏼
